### How to use

1. Download the datapack from `Releases` tab and place it into your mc datapack folder, rename it if needed.
2. After you changed/added recipes, make sure to keep `ONLY` files you have changed/added, everything else, if unchanged, should be removed.

### Addons Support
Every IC2C addon that adds custom recipes will be exported into the same archive together with IC2C files.  
By default, this pack won't provide addons recipes due to compat reasons. If you need to tweak IC2C addon's recipe, just use the same `/ic2c_export`, take the `data/ic2_addon_name` folder and copy it over into this clean IC2C datapack.
